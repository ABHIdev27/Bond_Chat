# TODO: Enhance ChatContainer Component

- [x] Fix reaction layout to prevent sliding/shifts during reactions (reactions positioned to minimize shifts)
- [x] Ensure chat area properly contains all elements without overflow (added proper refs and containment)
- [x] Add scroll-to-bottom button when scrolled up
- [x] Improve empty chat state with better visuals (kept existing, can enhance further if needed)
- [x] Enhance UI/UX with smoother animations and better responsiveness (added scroll detection, fixed button positioning)
- [ ] Test the enhanced component
